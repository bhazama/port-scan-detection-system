Procedure:
The first thing I did was take a look at the ssh.log text file.
While looking at the file I was able to figure out that it tracked
the host/destination IP adresses, some type of encrypted text (hashed passwords maybe?),
port numbers, and the status and type of connection being made. The next step was to count
the number of scans being made. This was stored in a variable called scan_count and was 
then written to the scanner_found.txt file. Afterwards, the host ip addresses were stored into
 a list called origin_ip and tthe destination ip addresses were stored in a list called destination_ip.
 Each list was looped through and appended the host/destination ip's data to the scanners_found file. 
 The end result was a scanners_found.txt file that contains the number of scans, host ip addresses,
 and destination ip addresses.

Summary:
From my log analysis I was able to find out how many scans were attempted
on various networks as well as the host IP's and destination IP's that each
host IP was trying to connect to.

Recommendations:
The next step for the log would be to sort the scans made through Nmap and further investigate those files
to see if any successful connections were made that could compromise the network. Also, it may be a good idea
to count the number of scans made by each host ip address and further investigate the ip's with the most scans.
